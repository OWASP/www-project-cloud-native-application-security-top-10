## Overview
Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach. Cloud-Native Applications are a fundamentally new and exciting approach to designing and building software. However, it also raises a completely new set of security challenges. For example, when you move to a microservice model, end-to-end visibility, monitoring and detection become more complex and difficult to execute.
