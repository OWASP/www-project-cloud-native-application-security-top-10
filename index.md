<p>Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, cloud functions (serverless), service meshes, micro-services, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach. Cloud-Native Applications is a fundamentally new and exciting approach to designing and building software. However, it also raises a completely new set of security challenges. For example, when you move to a microservice model, end-to-end visibility, monitoring and detection become more complex and difficult to execute.</p>
